      <p class="">As Bike &amp; Build enters its 15th summer as an organization, we would like to take the opportunity to thank our entire extended family of alumni, donors, hosts, build partners, and members of the community for all of your support over the years. Without you, our organizationâ€™s impact on the affordable housing landscape would not have been possible. Our now over 3,300 dedicated young adults who have participated in B&B have accomplished a lot these past 15 years, spending 225,000 hours volunteering on build sites and donating more than $6.2 million to hundreds of affordable housing organizations across the country. In addition to having an immediate, measurable impact on the affordable housing cause, our riders have built leadership and community service skills as well as a spirit they take into their careers, families and communities - all made possible by our dedicated supporters.</p>
      <p>In 2016, Bike &amp; Build once again continued its varied and widespread impact on both the affordable housing cause and the development of young adult leaders while we worked on additional measures to create more conversation around safety. We added a daily rotating position on each trip for riders to monitor the riding habits of their teammates from the vantage point of the support vehicle, where they assisted the driver and shared observations and suggestions on safety with fellow riders. We engaged multiple cycling organizations in regular communication to share safety protocols and employ best practices, and we consulted with companies such as Adventure Cycling Association and Fehr & Peers for extensive route planning and evaluation. Our alumni reached out to cycling advocacy organizations across the country while riders made calls to media outlets to alert communities of cyclists passing through the area. As we continue our efforts to ensure the safety of our participants, we also know that our riders - along with cyclists everywhere - rely on the people with whom they share the road to do their part by driving safely, watching for cyclists on the road, and never driving distracted.
      </p>
      <p class="">Even as we put in additional measures to increase awareness for our riders, our community experienced another tragedy in 2016. Anne Davis, an inspiring and passionate rider on our Central US route, was struck and killed by a distracted driver while cycling in Idaho. Her fellow rider, Laura Stark, sustained serious injuries and continues in her recovery efforts. We strive daily to honor the memory of Anne by continuing the mission for which she displayed such passion and commitment.
      </p>
      <p class="">As we look forward to 2017 and beyond, we also take time to look back and reflect. The Bike &amp; Build community has had an incredible impact throughout its history, while experiencing significant challenges. The strength that propels our organization has always derived from the support of our wider community, and for that we thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
      </p>
      <p class="">Our dedication to our participants, to our mission, and to the affordable housing cause could not be stronger.
